3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   - print("Hello,World")
       -Explanation of a basic syntax elements
          1.'print' function
             .'print' is a built-in python function that outputs text to the console
             .Functions in python are called using their name followed by parentheses.
          2.String:
             ."Hello,World!" is a string , a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks.
          3.Parenthesses:
            .the parenthesses are used to pass arguments to fuctions
     

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
      -Basic data types in python: 1.Intergers ('int') -whole numbers without a fractional part.
                                   2.Floating point-numbers-numbers with a decimal point
                                   3.Strings-sequence of characters enclosed in quotes .
                                   4.Booleans -Represents one of two values example true or false
                                   5.Lists- order,mutable collection of items, enclosed in square brankets
                                   6.Tuples -order,mutable collection of items, enclosed in parentheses   
5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.Conditional statements, like if-else, are used to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions. They allow your program to make decisions and respond differently based on the data or state.

if Statement: Checks a condition. If it is true, the code block following the if statement executes.
else Statement: Provides an alternative code block that executes if the condition in the if statement is false.
Loops
Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

for Loop: Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range). It executes the block of code once for each item in the sequence.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
In Python, functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to encapsulate logic, making your code more modular and organized. Functions can take input parameters, perform operations, and return results.

Why Functions are Useful
Code Reusability: Once a function is defined, you can call it multiple times throughout your program without duplicating code.
Modularity: Functions help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, improving code readability and maintainability.
Abstraction: Functions allow you to hide the implementation details and expose only the necessary functionality, making the code easier to understand.
Function Example
A function in Python can be defined to take two arguments and return their sum.




7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
Lists
Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements. The position of elements is determined by their insertion order.
Index-based: You access elements in a list using their index, which starts at 0.
Mutable: You can modify, add, or remove elements in a list after its creation.
Dictionaries
Unordered: Dictionaries do not maintain order for their keys. The order is generally not predictable.
Key-based: You access values in a dictionary using keys, which can be of various data types (strings, numbers, tuples, etc.).
Mutable: You can add, modify, or remove key-value pairs in a dictionary after its creation.
Script Example
In a script, you can:

Create a List: Initialize a list with a set of numbers.
Create a Dictionary: Initialize a dictionary with key-value pairs.
Perform Operations:
List: Append a number, remove an element, and access elements by index.
Dictionary: Add a new key-value pair, update an existing value, and access values by key.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.Exception handling in Python is a mechanism for managing errors that occur during the execution of a program. It allows you to handle unexpected situations gracefully without terminating the program abruptly.

Key Concepts
try Block: Contains the code that may potentially cause an error. This block is executed first.
except Block: Contains the code to handle the error if an exception occurs in the try block. It catches and responds to the exception.
finally Block: Contains code that will run regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.
Example
In a script, you might:

Use the try Block: Place code that could raise an exception (e.g., file operations or division).
Use the except Block: Specify the type of exception to handle and define how to handle it (e.g., print an error message).
Use the finally Block: Ensure that certain cleanup actions are performed, such as closing a file, even if an error occurred.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   - Modules
Definition: A module is a single file containing Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables that you can use in other scripts.
Purpose: Modules help you break down your code into manageable sections. By using modules, you can keep related code together and avoid duplication.
Packages
Definition: A package is a collection of modules organized in a directory hierarchy. It allows you to group related modules into a single directory with an __init__.py file.
Purpose: Packages facilitate the organization of modules into a namespace, making it easier to manage large codebases and avoid naming conflicts.
Importing and Using a Module
Importing: You can import a module into your script using the import statement. This allows you to access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module.
Using: After importing, you can call functions and access variables from the module using the module's name.
Example with the math Module
The math module provides mathematical functions and constants. To use it in your script:

Import the Module: Include an import statement at the beginning of your script.
Call Functions: Use functions from the math module, such as math.sqrt() for computing the square root.


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    - Reading from Files
Open the File: Use the open() function with the mode 'r' (read) to open the file.
Read the Content: Use methods like .read(), .readline(), or .readlines() to retrieve the file content.
Close the File: Always close the file using .close() to free up system resources.
Writing to Files
Open the File: Use the open() function with the mode 'w' (write) to open the file. This will create the file if it does not exist, or truncate the file if it does.
Write to the File: Use methods like .write() or .writelines() to write content to the file.
Close the File: Close the file using .close() to ensure the data is properly saved and resources are released.
Example Scripts
Reading from a File:

Open the file in read mode.
Read its content and print it to the console.
Writing to a File:

Open the file in write mode.
Write a list of strings to the file, each string typically written on a new line.
